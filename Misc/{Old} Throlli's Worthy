title:{WIP}Throlli's Wishlist up to Season of the Worthy
description:{WIP}Notes on specific roles on all guns in Destiny 2

/*
The Weapons will be listed based on their Archetype.
Exotics, Pinnacles and Ritual Weapons will be at the bottom to be able to access them more easily when they get changed.
If you want to edit notes search for the weapon name it should bring you there.
Also Future Warcult and Trials of the Nine Guns from Year 1 won't be included because I own none of them.

The marked Rolls are the best possible Rolls on the respective weapon.
Ranking is based on the current META. This includes Weapon Archetype and Frame.
Ranking:
Must have
Really good
Pretty good
Decent
Mediocre
Bad

{Roadmap} 
+ Structuring done
+ Exotic Weapons (Released prior to 14th March 2020) done
+ Season 9 and 10 Weapons done
+ Pinnacles and Ritual Weapons need to be formated but done
- Season 1-8 Weapons to do
- Constantly adding more Roles
- Exotic Armor might be added later
- Might be adding notes on Seasonal Mod Slots for Armor
- Finishing Sunshots Catalyst before adjusting the review (Mag increase with Shadowkeep helped it (Yeah it's Season of the Worthy by now and I haven't done the Catalyst yet))
- Maybe getting the Revoker to review it (In case I'm in your Trials Team: I got Revoker just using Mountaintop instead ;D)
