Appended mag (combined later with back up mag) gets the mag upto 7 rounds. NOTE: bottomless grief also allows for this.  Triple tap - hitting crits will refill 1 round into the mag allowing for 10 total shots before reloading. Vorpal weapon - Increased damage vs bosses + vehicles. Honorable mention to clown cartridge as once you fire one shot and reload you can reach upto 11 rounds in the mag. [Recommended MW: Range]
