How do I use DIM Wishlists?

First you need to go into your DIM settings and scroll down to "Wish List". Now you can either download a Wishlist and add it by dragging it to where it says "Click or drag files".
Alternatively you can do what I would recommend and let DIM pull your Wishlists right of GitHub. This allows you to update with one click.
Once you have loaded the Wishlists you want simply typing is:wishlist into the searchbar should mark everything on the applied Wishlists.

If you want to add my Wishlist via GitHub copy the following URL into your DIM:
