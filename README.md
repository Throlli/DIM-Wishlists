I am posting my DIM Wishlists here.

How do I use DIM Wishlists?

First you need to go into your DIM settings and find "Wish List". Now you can either download a Wishlist and add it by dragging it to where it says "Click or drag files".
Alternatively you can do what I would recommend and let DIM pull your Wishlists right of GitHub. This allows you to update with one click and allows you to easily combine multiple wishlists.


Just my Wishlist updated via GitHub

If you just want to use my Master Wishlist copy the following URL and paste it into you DIM:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Throlli/DIM-Wishlists/master/(WIP)%20Destiny%202%20Master%20Wishlist.txt


My Wishlist and voltron updated via GitHub (recommended)

If you want to use my Master Wishlist whilst also using the voltron Wishlist (Which includes @AyyItsChevy's S14 Super Pog PvE Loot List, Wishlists by u/Mercules904 and more) copy the following URLs and paste them into your DIM.

My Wishlist and choosy_voltron

If you want to use my Master Wishlist whilst also using the choosy_voltron Wishlist (voltron with some added Rolls if I remember correctly) copy the following URLs and paste them into your DIM.
