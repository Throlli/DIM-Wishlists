What Rolls does this list contain?
Rolls that are good for PVE with a focus on Endgame Content. My [Godroll Spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15JQz5SZXuXdotzLr5o9fp4JQY4DuTHxDmTNbU0f4kZM/view) contains all the rolls from the Main Wishlist.

How do I use DIM Wishlists?
First you need to go into your DIM settings and find "Wish List". Now you can either download a Wishlist and add it by dragging it to where it says "Click or drag files".
Alternatively you can do what I would recommend and let DIM pull your Wishlists right of GitHub. This allows you to update with one click.
Once you have loaded the Wishlists you want simply typing is:wishlist into the searchbar should mark everything on the applied Wishlists.

If you want to add my Wishlist by URL copy the following URL into "Add another wish list" in your DIM settings:
